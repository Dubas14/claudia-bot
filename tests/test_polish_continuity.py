"""Locks for the continuity polish after the live Quick run inside a real Grok Bot (e2e/QUICK-E2E.md, PASS: v1 for
$1.06, lyric gate 74/74, 13 user turns, 1 % -> 4 % of a Pro+ week incl. the install):

1. a bot cannot wake itself: THE TURN RULE lives once in the profile (bounded `job wait --max 25`, about 10 a turn, up
   to a checkpoint; else an explicit 'say continue'); every skill that starts a long job points to it. Since the live
   Studio run (e2e/STUDIO-E2E.md) the continue line goes out FIRST, before any wait over ~2 min, because the platform
   ends a turn silently ~5-6 min into a long call (tests/test_studio_skills.py);
2. usage claims are the measured ones (about 0.25 % of a Pro+ week a reply; Quick 10-15 replies);
3. the setup probes the toolkit before announcing an install;
4. a bare "continue" names what it approves;
5. Quick runs with no key at all (GenerateImage stills, no clips); Studio needs OpenRouter or Higgsfield;
6. the approved lead close-up anchors every later lead plate. Review fixes: the lead batch runs alone (`gen image
   --jobs --only`; a full book written while the board waited holds every plate), and the anchored book is the FULL
   book (`gate prompts --approve` needs plates/prompts.md; a --missing/--only book is a subset, prompts-B.md); the
   turn rule keeps dependent steps waiting ("meanwhile only work that does not need it").

The skills sit a few bytes under their budgets, so a later trim must not silently undo any of these. No network.
