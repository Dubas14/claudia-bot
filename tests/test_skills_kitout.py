"""Locks for the KIT-OUT skills fixes: the walks of a new user with (a) only Grok Bot, (b) Grok Bot + OpenRouter
+ Suno + Midjourney and (c) everything incl. Claude Code, Codex, Muse and an NVIDIA PC must never dead-end. The skills
sit a few bytes under their budgets, so a later trim must not silently undo any of these."""
