// Claudia chapters (Claude Code Workflow script). Generalised from the reference videos' chapter workflows
// (animate -> art director on real renders -> fix, and the v2 form: review -> fix -> review 2 -> fix 2 with the owner's
// taste weighted double). Intentional changes, each from a recorded failure:
//  - WIRING: the engine page loads only <project>/engine/ch/_index.js, so a chapter file it does not list is never
//    rendered — and the lyric gate still prints N/N, because the default renderer subtitles every sung word. The
//    reference workflow relied on the project page already loading each file; here the delegation runner wires the files
//    before the engine starts (args.wired) and otherwise a Setup agent runs `deleg.mjs wire`. Animators never touch
//    _index.js; every review runs the wiring check (`deleg.mjs wire --check`) and NOT WIRED blocks the chapter.
//  - A null, empty or render-less review is a FAILED review (retried once), never "nothing to fix": a usage limit once
//    made every round-2 review return nothing and the runs still reported "completed". Fixes applied but never
//    re-reviewed in a planned round 2 make the run ok:false ("incomplete"), so a resume is not forgotten.
//  - Calibrated pass rule: pass = no BLOCKING fix left and owner >= 7 and craft/sync/story >= 6 and the lyric gate N/N
//    (and the chapter wired). The old "director >= 8 and others >= 7" bar passed 1 chapter in 9 while the owner called
//    the cut built from the 7-7.5 chapters "perfect. change nothing" — so the bar is now what would stop a chapter
//    shipping, not a number. The reviewer's own pass flag is recorded but the script decides. Override with args.pass_rule.
//  - RENDER LOAD: the reference ran at most 2 agents per workflow and rendered with --workers 2; six agents rendering at
//    once once ate swap and filled the disk. Here at most args.parallel_chapters (2) chapters run at once and every
//    render command passes --workers args.render_workers (2); the runner runs one "render" job at a time.
//  - Code is written against the engine's device library (engine/DEVICES.md), not a project's private kit; render,
//    sheet, gate and history checks go through the toolkit CLI (`slop render ...`).
//  - mode "refit" (re-key a built chapter to re-made footage and apply carried-over fixes) is the v2 refit pass; the
//    edit is rebuilt ONCE in Setup, never by each animator (parallel animators once raced on edit export).
// Resume: Workflow({scriptPath: <this file>, resumeFromRunId: <run>, args: <same args>}); an animator whose file
// already has scenes continues from it. Run 3–4 chapters per workflow.

First run the wiring check and the page boot: a chapter that is NOT WIRED is not on screen at all (the default renderer draws its shots), so judging its renders would judge the wrong code — report it as a blocking fix and score what is on screen.
Render and LOOK yourself — your opinion of code you have not seen rendered is worthless: the lyric gate; contact sheets of at least ${SHEETS} times (every shot's first, middle and last frame, every lyric line, every hit moment, every transition middle) and full-size stills of the 5 most important moments; a 12 fps render of the range checked against analysis/hits.json (moves and cuts on the sounds, nothing drifting). Read every image. Compare each shot with its storyboard entry and the bar above.
Judge every shot: the explaining graphic (shows what the words mean, in one glance); lyric timing and legibility on a phone; beat sync; density (>= 3 layers); the 2.5D treatment (layered, alive, different from its neighbours); transitions (motivated, never amateurish or repeated); colour (the footage keeps its colour); type never over a face; on-model lead; performance (ms/frame <= ${MSF}).
Score 0–10: owner (counts double), craft, sync, story. ${SEVERITY} At most ${MAX_FIX} fixes, the most important first, each concrete (shot, time, problem, fix). Fill checks with the exact lyric gate line, the exact wiring line and how many frames you looked at. If a render command fails, say so in checks.lyric_gate and score only what you could see — never invent numbers. Do not edit any file.`,
