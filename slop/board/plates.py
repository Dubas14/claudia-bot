"""slop plates — the plate pipeline: prompt book + Midjourney paste batches, ingest, picking sheets, picks, vary.

  slop plates book [--batch B] [--only P,..] [--missing] [--plan basic|standard|pro|mega]
      plates/prompts.md (the book the owner reads before anything is generated; a subset book from --only/--missing is
      plates/prompts-<B>.md, so the full book is never overwritten by a re-roll), plates/mj/<B>.json (the batch: jobs
      with their exact prompts, used by ingest to identify downloads; a subset never reuses a batch that holds other
      plates), plates/mj/<B>.perm-<k>.txt (one paste each: up to 4/10/40 prompts in Midjourney permutation braces, every
      inner comma escaped as "\\,", the params after the braces), plates/mj/<B>.lines.txt (one prompt per line, the
      alternative) and plates/jobs.json (merged by plate) + plates/api/<plate>.txt (API image jobs, each with the exact
      `slop -p P gen image --plate P --prompt-file F` command; project board.api_candidates, default 2 images a plate).
      Pre-flight (research 11-gap-6 §7.2): lint (framing first, canon, no-text tail, <= 800 chars, the FAR variant on
      FS/WS/EWS plates), the Fast GPU-minute estimate (jobs x 1.3 min HD, 0.8 SD), the queue rule (never more than 10
      queued jobs on Basic/Standard). plates[] entries no shot or clip uses are skipped.
      Sung plates (the plate of a shot with motion tier sung or a motion shot on a sung clip, or of a planned sung
      window: the lip-sync start frames) get "her mouth fully visible, nothing in front of her mouth" (his/their from
      lead.pronoun) before the style tail; API jobs add "(no microphone, hand or hair)" (a canon headset: "(the headset
      microphone at her cheek, clear of her lips; no hand or hair)"); Midjourney prompts name no object there (MJ
      draws what a prompt names, negated or not). A microphone, a hand at the mouth or something over it in their
      prompt is a lint warning (the Studio run: a mic at her mouth held a clip to 26 %).
      --anchor PLATE[:K] (after the owner approved the lead at G3 and the plate is picked; no K = its pick): every lead
      plate's API job (a plate with a lead_on_screen shot, the anchor's own plate aside) gets "refs": [that image] and
      "anchor": "PLATE:K", its cmd gets `--ref PLATE:K`; jobs.json records {"anchor": {ref, plate, k, file, at,
      plates}, "anchored": [...]}. Sticky: a later book keeps it (a note when the pick has changed since); --no-anchor
      drops it (DECISIONS.md logs both). Refused when the project's image model takes no reference images. Midjourney
      plates never get one (identity stays text there).
  slop plates ingest DIR|ZIP|FILE [--batch B] [--map KEY=PLATE ...] [--force]
      downloads -> plates/cands/<plate>/<k>.jpg (+ plates/cands/index.json with source names and sha256, deduped).
      Recognised names: "<plate>-<k>.png" / "<plate>_<k>.jpg" (Grok GenerateImage / API outputs, older batch tools,
      Drive copies; plate names match in any case), "<plate>/<k>.png" (DIR may also be the plate's own folder; k is
      kept when free), with no board and no batch yet a plate-like "<name>-<k>.png" or "<name>/<k>.png" makes plate
      <name> (never DIR itself, a date, or a name a tool gives on its own: image-1, Screenshot-…); a folder named after
      a plate, Midjourney website downloads "<user>_<prompt words>_<job uuid>_<n>.png" (grouped by uuid; each job
      should have 4 images, else a warning), CDN "<uuid>/0_<n>.png", and names without a uuid such as
      "<user>_<prompt words>_<hash>.png" (grouped by the name without its trailing index). Refused: plates/cands/
      itself or a folder holding it (the project), and a candidate file without --plate/--map. A group is matched to a
      batch prompt by the prompt embedded in the file (PNG text, XMP dc:description, EXIF ImageDescription/UserComment)
      when present, else by the normalised prompt text found anywhere in the name if exactly one prompt fits — never by
      position. Unmatched groups (e.g. lead plates whose names only show the shared framing + canon) go on
      plates/unmatched.jpg; map them with --map <uuid-prefix | file name | file stem>=<plate> (the plate must be on the
      board or in a batch) and re-run (already ingested files are skipped by hash). Originals are kept byte for byte in
      plates/mj/<batch>/orig/ (plates/orig/ without --batch); the candidates are JPEG q95 copies.
  slop plates sheet [--plates P,..]        numbered picking sheets (<= 10 plates a sheet) -> plates/sheets/pick-NN.jpg
  slop plates pick PLATE K [PLATE K ...]   (also "p001#2, p004#4") -> plates/picks.json {plate: {file, cand_k, shot_ids}};
      refuses a candidate that a variant of the same plate already shows (it would put one image on two moments).
  slop plates vary [--dry]                 one image per shot: a plate on several shots that are not one continuous
      moment gives the later shots its other candidates as variant plates "<plate>~<k>"; two clips never start from the
      same frame (port of vary.py; the owner: "two seedance videos shouldnt start from the exact same frame"). It
      rewrites board/shots.json: on an approved board it warns that the board gate is stale (the owner sees the sheet).
  slop plates status                       per plate: candidates, pick, shots, prompt state.

Changes from the source: no credentialed browser and no MJ automation (human in the loop, research 11-gap-6 §7); the
profile code is only ever the user's own (project.json mj.profile) and never taken from params; identity is text
(project.json lead.canon / lead.far, placeholders {lead} {far} {possessive}); vary's state/shots ordering bug is fixed
(both files written together) and continuous followers move with their shot.
