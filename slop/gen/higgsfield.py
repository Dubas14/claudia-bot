"""Higgsfield path: the CLI writes a request file; the BOT executes it with its Higgsfield connector (MCP); the CLI ingests
the result. (Template users have the connector, not an API key — so the CLI never calls Higgsfield itself.)

Request shape (the one that ran 81 takes in production, field rules verbatim):
  model "seedance_2_5"; mode "omni_reference" ALWAYS explicit (the model default is t2v and silently ignores media);
  resolution "720p" (7 credits/s) or "480p" + draft:true (3 credits/s, can be finalized to 1080p within 7 days);
  aspect_ratio explicit; duration integer 4–8; medias [{role, value: media_id}] ordered start_image, image_references,
  video_references, audio_references — a start_image is @Image1, so a reference beside it is @Image2 (the prompt is
  renumbered for that); generate_audio omitted (= true) for sung clips, false only for motion clips; never use_unlim.
Preflight: generate_video {params: {..., get_cost: true}} returns the credits without submitting (not allowed inside
generate_video_batch). Submit verbatim with generate_video_batch {requests:[...]} — never edit the prompt; write the job
id down immediately; on a transport timeout the outcome is unknown: do NOT resubmit (check `transactions` first).
Failures: "failed" with no reason = the silent input filter (refunded; identical resubmits fail — reword without changing
the beat); "nsfw" = the output was flagged (refunded; change the staging, not the image); a preset recommendation
instead of a job = resubmit that item once with declined_preset_id set to the named preset.
Result URLs are public CloudFront links (no auth): `slop clip ingest CLIP --url URL --job-id ID [--credits N]`.
Uploads (verified 2026-10-01): media_import_url on an https URL works for images AND audio and is preferred; `slop clip
submit` puts the start image, references and window on the running quick tunnel itself, and `slop gen host CLIP --role
start|audio --tunnel` does it later (both fill uploads[].https_url, method "media_import_url", in the open request
file). The fallback media_upload presigned PUT needs the signed header `If-None-Match: *` or it answers 403.
Finalize (`slop clip submit CLIP --finalize-from TAKE`): a kept 480p draft (draft:true) can be finalized at 1080p within 7
days with draft_job_id = the draft's job id; observed 12 credits/s (get_cost is the truth). A finalize may not keep the
draft's lip sync, so a sung clip's finalized take must be measured again (`slop clip sync`).
Credits per second (seedance_2_5, observed 2026-09/10; get_cost is the truth): 480p draft 3, 720p 7, 1080p 12.
Refused or failed, never left "requested" (Studio run: a refused finalize read "submitted" and its 48 credits stayed in
the ledger, 114 logged vs 66 real): when get_cost or generate_video_batch answers an error instead of a price / a job
id, or the balance is too low, nothing was charged and the bot records it at once: `slop clip ingest CLIP --failed
"rejected: <the reply, verbatim>"` (the REJECTED step comes after the unlim_choice / timeout step: neither of those is a
refusal, and a timeout may have run and been charged); a job that ends failed / nsfw: `--failed "<reason>"`. The ledger then
records that take as failed with 0 credits (ledger.record turns the refund into a settlement) and `slop status` shows
a finalize as rejected / failed while the clip keeps its draft. A take delivered free (use_unlim) is ingested with
`--credits 0`.
Motion clips on Higgsfield default to a start_image (`slop clip new … --provider higgsfield`: frame "first") plus the
audio_references window — the second video ran its Higgsfield motion clips that way (exact plate composition, the beat
still conditioned). OpenRouter's "a first frame drops the audio" limit does not apply here.
