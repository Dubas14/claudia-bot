# Claudia setup - installs and sign-ins

You set up; Opus makes. The main path: the claudia.gallery MCP, the toolkit, Opus (Claude Code on your computer, on the person's Claude plan) and the person's X sign-in in your browser (Grok Imagine). Everything else is optional and can come later ("setup" brings this back). One widget per reply; never re-ask what the import asked. Before the install, `slop` = /workspace/claudia/bin/slop.

## Reply 1 - what they have or will get
Only after the welcome (skill claudia-welcome) and its "Set me up?" answer. Welcome not shown in this chat yet (an install message can skip it): run skill claudia-welcome now and stop here. Never repeat the welcome.
One multi-select widget "Which do you have, or are willing to get?": Claude Max / Claude Pro / ChatGPT Plus or Pro / X Premium or SuperGrok / OpenRouter key / Suno Pro or Premier / Midjourney (Just the basics: only the first four).
An account they will get but do not have yet: at its step below, first send its sign-up page (claude.ai, chatgpt.com, grok.com, openrouter.ai, higgsfield.ai, suno.com, midjourney.com) and go on when they say done; "later": skip it for now ("setup" brings it back).

## Reply 2 - install (no spend)
1. Code: `export GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0; test -f /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh || git clone -q https://github.com/anabologyco-maker/claudia-bot /workspace/claudia; git -C /workspace/claudia checkout -q v0.3.1` (no tag: fine).
2. Toolkit: `bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh --check --json`. `ok` true and `profile` full: say "toolkit ready" (no install). Else say "installing, about 5 min" and run it detached (the profile's turn rule):
   `nohup setsid bash -c 'bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh --minimal && bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh --full' > /workspace/claudia-install.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &`
3. Record their answers (after the install's `--minimal` part, `slop` works):
   - `slop --json onboard set tier director` (Opus does the work in every project).
   - `slop --json onboard set coding-agents claude,codex` (only the ticked plans: claude = Claude Max or Pro, codex = ChatGPT; none ticked: claude).
   - `slop --json onboard set suno-plan pro` (pro, premier, free or none). Midjourney not ticked: `slop --json onboard set mj-plan none`.
   - `slop --json onboard mark higgsfield --skip` (Higgsfield comes in a later update).
4. A question widget: "Connect the claudia.gallery MCP? (Claudia's canon, her wiki and 1,927 real prompts; public, read-only, no account.)"

## Reply 3 - claudia.gallery MCP
After the yes: add a custom MCP server named claudia at https://claudia.gallery/mcp (Streamable HTTP, no key). Test: call claudia_canon; it answers with her constants (the black bob, one clay-orange streak, the star clip, the headset mic). Fails: try once more next reply; still failing: go on, Opus reads the same site.

## Reply 4 on - sign-ins, one per reply (the person signs in, never you)
1. Opus: skill setup-agents, On the box: install claude and the person signs it in (ChatGPT only: codex). Then `slop --json relay setup` (ChatGPT only: add `--engine codex`; it gives Opus the claudia.gallery MCP, Claudia's skill and its brief). `ok` false: do its `next`. Then wake-ups: skill claudia-relay, Wake-ups.
2. X for Grok Imagine (X Premium or SuperGrok): open https://grok.com/imagine in your browser. Signed out: "Please sign in to grok.com with your X account in my browser. I never type passwords." Wait for their "done"; you see the Imagine page signed in: add a memory line "grok.com signed in" with today's date. No X plan: say Opus will use the other routes; go on.
3. Optional, only what they ticked: the OpenRouter key (sung lip-sync clips, API stills): skill setup-accounts. Suno and Midjourney: skill setup-accounts (they sign in once in your browser; from then on you run them).
4. What is done and what is left: `slop --json onboard status` (send its `text`). Long installs: the profile's turn rule.

## Hand-off
Say once: "Ready. Tell me what to make with Claudia: a still, a clip, a song, a music video. Opus asks you at most six questions on the way (the idea, the song, her face, the board, the cost, the first cut) and spends nothing without your yes. Say 'effort' any time to set how hard it thinks." Their next message: skill claudia-relay.
