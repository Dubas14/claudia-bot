# Claudia toolkit - repair, update, files

Code /workspace/claudia (git). Runtime /workspace/.claudia. Projects /workspace/slop/projects. Docs /workspace/claudia/docs/: the map is docs/00-overview.md, known failures docs/99-failures.md. You repair and move files; Opus does the work (skill claudia-relay).

## Repair (computer updated, `slop` missing, import errors)
1. `bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh --check --json`: `missing` names what is gone (a computer update removes packages; /workspace stays).
2. `bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh` re-installs the last profile and downloads only what is missing. It takes minutes: run it detached, `nohup setsid bash /workspace/claudia/bin/setup.sh > /workspace/claudia-install.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &`, then repeat step 1 (the profile's turn rule). Then PATH: `grep -qs claudia/env.sh ~/.bashrc || echo '. /workspace/.claudia/env.sh' >> ~/.bashrc; grep -qs claudia/env.sh ~/.profile || echo '. /workspace/.claudia/env.sh' >> ~/.profile`.
3. `slop --json doctor`: fix each WARN or FAIL with the line after its `->`. Once per computer: `slop --json job selftest`.
4. Opus: `slop --json agents status`; missing after an update: `slop --json agents install claude` and `slop --json relay setup` (skill setup-agents). What else is missing: `slop --json onboard status` (skill claudia-setup).
5. /workspace/claudia gone: run the install lines in skill claudia-setup (Reply 2).
## Update (the person says update, or yes to the reminder)
1. `slop --json update apply`. Opus is working: it says so; tell the person and try again after Opus finishes. Local changes: send its error.
2. Do its `next`: read /workspace/claudia/skills/dist/recipe.json and re-apply it to yourself exactly: your profile, every skill byte for byte, the memory entry.
3. Tell the person in at most 4 lines: "Updated to vX" plus its `notes`. `installing` true: the new version is still installing in the background (the profile's turn rule; `slop --json update check` later).
"Is there an update?": `slop --json update check`.

## Reading results
`slop --json ...` prints one JSON object. `ok` true: report `text` in a line or two and follow `next`. `ok` false: `error` says what to do next; do that, never retry blindly. A usage error also prints `usage`.

## Money
Only Opus spends, after the person's yes. A complaint about quality: relay it at once, `slop --json relay send '<their words>'`; Opus freezes all spending. Real spend is the provider's bill (OpenRouter key usage; Higgsfield's `balance` and `transactions`).

## Keys
Only the masked secure secret card (OPENROUTER_API_KEY; agent sign-in codes and tokens: skill setup-agents). Never in chat, files or commands. A key pasted in chat: ask the person to revoke it and send a new one on the card.

## Files in and out
- In, chat: up to 6 attachments a message, 25 MiB each (video 200 MiB). Tell Opus where it is: `slop --json relay send '[file] the person sent PATH'` (full path).
- In, bigger: a Google Drive or Dropbox share link: `slop --json -p NAME fetch 'LINK' --to uploads`, then tell Opus the `file` it prints the same way. Many files: one zip by link.
- In, from the person's computer: CopyToBox, 100 MiB per file, one approval each.
- Out: the files Opus posts (relay read) go to the person as attachments; over 190 MiB: CopyFromBox to the person's computer.
